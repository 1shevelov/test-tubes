"tubes" (array of arrays)
Each member of "tubes" is an array representing one tube. A level can have 1 to 16 tubes.
Each element (number) of a tube array - is the smallest portion. A tube's volume ranges from 1 to 8 portions. The top volume(portion) of a tube has index 0. A value of each element represent a color of liquid, from 1 to 10. 0 (zero) - is an empty volume (portion).

It is not allowed to have 0 (empty portion) lower (higher array index) than liquid portion. [1, 2, 0] - is an error, level wouldn't be playable.


(optional) "drains" (array of numbers)
Should has the same size as tubes array. Each element shows holes or faucets for a tube:
   0 - standard tube with open neck that allows to pour in and out. (a FIFO stack)
   1 - a tube with a bottom faucet only alowing to pour out (drain), but not to pour in.
   2 - a tube with both an open neck and a bottom faucet. Neck allows to pour in and out while faucet only for pouring out. (working as a FIFO + FILO stack)
 
 
(optional) "win_color" (number):
   0 (default) - Gather all colors, each in it's own container, to win
   1..10 - Gather only one color with this number in any one tube to win.
   
At least one portion of this color should be present in tubes. It would be an unconditional win if only one portion of win_color is present or all portions of this color are in the same tube at the end of the first move.
 
 
Moves limit for any level is 50. The game will finish with a "LOSE" after fiftieth move.
